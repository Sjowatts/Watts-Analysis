  <h2>Welcome to Watts Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    I'm Sam Watts — a dedicated and data-driven sports performance analyst with experience across elite football, basketball, squash, netball, and cricket. Watts Analysis is my personal platform to showcase the work I’ve done, the insights I bring, and the value I can offer to professional clubs, academies, and organisations.
  </p>
  <p>
    I combine deep tactical understanding with cutting-edge analysis tools to deliver clear, actionable insights that support coaching decisions, player development, and recruitment. This site features my portfolio, CV, and examples of projects I’ve led or contributed to — each grounded in evidence-based practice and elite performance environments. If you're looking for someone to strengthen your analysis department, I’d love to hear from you.
