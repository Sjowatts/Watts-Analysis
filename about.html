  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m Sam Watts, a multi-sport performance analyst with a passion for turning data into tactical clarity. My experience spans football, basketball, squash, netball, and cricket — working with professional clubs, academies, and national programs to deliver insights that inform coaching, recruitment, and player development.
  </p>
  <p>
    My background includes placements and analysis work with organisations such as Liverpool FC, Cheltenham Town, Bath City FC, Team GB Taekwondo, and the RFU. I’ve contributed to match analysis, recruitment dossiers, set-piece tracking, and opponent profiling — always with a strong focus on impact, efficiency, and innovation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Academically, I hold a Master's degree in Performance Analysis and have authored research into rally intensity in elite squash. I'm highly proficient with tools like Hudl Sportscode, Wyscout, Dartfish, Python, Excel, and custom-built video/data pipelines. Whether live coding a match, visualising key trends, or supporting scouting strategy, I aim to bring detail, clarity, and consistency to every project.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of analysis, I founded and manage the Cardiff Vikings basketball club, where I lead operations, coaching, and strategy. I'm always open to new opportunities — whether it’s a full-time role or freelance project — so feel free to explore my portfolio or get in touch.
