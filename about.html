    <h1>About Watts Analysis</h1>
    <p>I‚Äôm a dedicated and versatile sports performance analyst with experience across football, basketball, squash, rugby, cricket, netball, and taekwondo. I‚Äôve worked with elite performance environments including Liverpool FC, Bath City FC, Cheltenham Town, Team GB Taekwondo, and the RFU, focusing on tactical analysis, recruitment, and athlete development. I hold a Master‚Äôs degree in Performance Analysis and regularly use tools like Python, Jupyter, and OpenCV to combine video analysis with data-driven insights that help teams improve both tactically and technically. 
      
      During my academic research, I built custom scripts to extract and analyze squash rally data, turning complex match patterns into meaningful visualizations.

Outside of my analysis work, I‚Äôm the founder and coach of the Cardiff Vikings Basketball Club ‚Äî a team I started with former university teammates to continue competing at a high level. The long-term vision is to build a multi-team structure including women‚Äôs and junior squads, creating a full pathway for talent development. I also design and maintain websites using HTML, CSS, and React, applying the same attention to detail and design thinking that I bring to performance workflows. Whether it‚Äôs automating data processes on my MacBook or designing a personal basketball half-court in France, I bring energy, initiative, and a performance mindset to everything I do.

What sets me apart is my ability to connect data with real-world performance. 

I‚Äôm confident working with large datasets, developing custom tools for analysis, and creating visuals and reports that coaches, scouts, and players can act on. I‚Äôve delivered performance insights in team sports like football and basketball, as well as individual or hybrid sports like squash and taekwondo. I‚Äôve also applied my analytical framework to cricket and netball, tailoring workflows to meet the specific tempo, structure, and tactical demands of each sport ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs breakdown efficiency in netball or bowling sequences in cricket.

I‚Äôm now actively looking for the next step in my career and excited to bring my experience, creativity, and work ethic to a forward-thinking club or organization. If you‚Äôre looking for someone who understands the game, the data, and how to bridge that gap effectively ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to connect.</p>
